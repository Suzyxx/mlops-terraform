# MLOps Course — Project Notes & Video Script

These notes build up lesson by lesson into the script for the final video.
For each lesson: **what** we did, **how**, **why** it matters, and **what problem
it solves**. Extra-credit exploration ideas are marked 🌟.

## Lesson 1 — Infrastructure as Code with Terraform

**What we did:** Wrote two text files (`terraform/provider.tf`, `terraform/s3.tf`)
describing an AWS S3 bucket, then used Terraform to create it in AWS.

**How:**
- `provider.tf` declares the cloud (AWS), region (`eu-west-1`), and provider version.
- `s3.tf` declares one resource: an S3 bucket with a globally-unique name.
- Credentials are supplied via environment variables, never written in the code.
- Workflow: `terraform init` → `validate` → `fmt` → `plan` → `apply` (→ `destroy`).

**Why Infrastructure as Code instead of clicking in the AWS console?**
- **Reproducible** — anyone can recreate the exact same setup from the files.
- **Version-controlled** — infra lives in git; changes are tracked and reversible.
- **No manual drift** — code is the single source of truth, not undocumented clicks.
- **Scalable** — the same file can spin up dev/test/prod identically (lesson 2).

**Why an S3 bucket first?** It's the storage foundation of the whole project —
later it holds data, trained models, and Terraform's own state file. This is
"maturity level 0": the simplest real piece of cloud infra, managed as code.

**Problem it solves:** ML projects break when infra is built by hand and nobody
can reproduce it. IaC makes the environment itself versioned and repeatable —
the bedrock of MLOps.

**Key commands explained:**
- `terraform init` — downloads the AWS provider plugin (run once per project).
- `terraform validate` — checks the config syntax is correct.
- `terraform fmt` — auto-formats files to a consistent style.
- `terraform plan` — previews changes without making them (dry run).
- `terraform apply` — actually creates/changes the infrastructure.
- `terraform destroy` — tears everything down (avoids leftover costs).

🌟 **Extra-credit ideas to explore:**
- **Remote state**: Terraform stores state locally by default; teams move it to
  S3 + DynamoDB locking so the team shares one source of truth and avoids
  concurrent-edit corruption. (Touched in lesson 2 — can go deeper.)
- **Least-privilege IAM**: the lesson uses root/admin keys; production uses a
  scoped-down IAM role with only the permissions it needs — why that matters.

---

## Lesson 2 — Scaling IaC (modules, environments, remote state, CI/CD)

### Why lesson 2 exists (the big picture)

Lesson 1 reached **"maturity level 0"**: Terraform worked, but it ran *only on my
laptop*, with *one hardcoded bucket*, and the **state file lived locally**. That's
fine solo, but it breaks the moment (a) there's more than one environment, (b) more
than one person/machine touches the infra, or (c) a robot (CI) needs to run it.
Lesson 2 fixes all three with four moving parts:

| Part | What it is | The problem it solves |
|------|-----------|----------------------|
| **Remote state backend** | Move `terraform.tfstate` off the laptop into an S3 bucket, with locking + versioning | Local state can't be shared, can't be locked (two applies corrupt it), and is lost if the laptop dies. *The* prerequisite for teamwork + CI. |
| **Modules** | A reusable `modules/s3-bucket/` component | Stop copy-pasting resource blocks. Define "how we make a bucket" once, reuse everywhere (DRY). |
| **Multi-environment** | `environments/dev.tfvars` + `backends/dev.conf` (and tst/prd) | Same code, different inputs per stage. Promote dev→tst→prd without rewriting anything. |
| **GitHub Actions CI/CD** | A workflow that runs init→validate→plan→**approve**→apply on a pull request | Infra changes become reviewed, auditable, and automated — not "someone ran apply on their laptop." Needs AWS keys stored as GitHub repo secrets. |

🌟 **The "chicken-and-egg" problem:** the S3 bucket that holds Terraform's state
can't itself be created by the Terraform that *uses* it — so we **bootstrap that one
bucket manually first**, then everything else is managed as code.

### Key concept: state file vs. the actual resources (this confused me at first)

The remote-state backend bucket does **NOT** "manage" or "contain" the other buckets.
It stores the **state file** — and the state file is just Terraform's *notebook*, not
the buckets themselves.

- **The real bucket** lives in AWS S3 as an actual resource (the thing you see in the
  AWS console).
- **The state file** (`terraform.tfstate`) is a JSON ledger where Terraform writes
  down: *"I created a bucket named X, with these settings."* It's Terraform's
  **memory** of what it has built, so that on the next `plan` it can compare
  "what I think exists" vs. "what the code now says" and compute the difference.

By default that notebook sits **on the laptop**. The remote backend bucket's only job
is to **hold the notebook in the cloud instead**, so it can be shared and locked.

```
        ┌─────────────────────────────┐
        │  Backend S3 bucket          │   ← stores the NOTEBOOK (tfstate)
        │  "tf-remote-backend-..."    │      "I manage bucket X, bucket Y..."
        └──────────────┬──────────────┘
                       │ describes
            ┌──────────┴───────────┐
            ▼                      ▼
   ┌─────────────────┐   ┌─────────────────┐
   │ datastore bucket│   │  (more buckets) │   ← the ACTUAL resources
   └─────────────────┘   └─────────────────┘
```

So **destroying the old lesson-1 bucket and creating the remote-state bucket are
unrelated actions.** The backend bucket is new bookkeeping storage; the old bucket is
just an empty leftover resource. (Decision for this project: clean-slate — destroy the
empty lesson-1 bucket so the new modular structure rebuilds it the "mature" way.)

### Why remote state matters (3 concrete wins)
- **State Locking** — prevents two `apply` runs at once from corrupting state.
- **Versioning** — roll back to an earlier state if something goes wrong.
- **Encryption** — secrets that land in the state file are encrypted at rest.

### Core idea of the restructure: separate CODE from CONFIG (the DRY principle)

Lesson 2 splits the project into two kinds of files:

- **Code** (`provider.tf`, `variables.tf`, `s3_buckets.tf`, the module) — the *logic*:
  **how** things are built. Written **once**. It never names a specific region,
  environment, or bucket; it uses blanks like `var.aws_region`, `var.environment`.
- **Config** (`environments/dev.tfvars`, `tst.tfvars`, `prd.tfvars`) — the *values*:
  **what** to plug into those blanks for each stage. **One file per environment.**

Deploying = run the same code with a different config file:
```
terraform apply -var-file=environments/dev.tfvars   # → environment "dev"
terraform apply -var-file=environments/prd.tfvars   # → environment "prd"
```

**Why this is better than hardcoding.** If values were baked into the code, having
dev and prd differ would force you to either (a) hand-edit the code before every
deploy (error-prone, and you can't tell what's deployed where), or (b) copy the whole
project per environment (every fix made N times; copies drift apart). The variable +
tfvars approach avoids both: the thing that *varies* lives in a tiny per-env file; the
thing that *stays the same* lives in code maintained once. That's **DRY — Don't Repeat
Yourself** — applied to infrastructure.

What actually differs across our environments:

| | dev.tfvars | tst.tfvars | prd.tfvars |
|---|---|---|---|
| `environment` | `"dev"` | `"tst"` | `"prd"` |
| `aws_region` | `eu-west-1` | `eu-west-1` | `eu-west-1` |
| resulting bucket | `...-datastore-dev` | `...-datastore-tst` | `...-datastore-prd` |

Same code, three isolated environments, driven entirely by swapping one `-var-file`.
🌟 Region *could* differ per env too (e.g. prd in `eu-central-1`) — just change one
line in that env's tfvars, no code edit. For this project all three stay `eu-west-1`;
the point is the **capability**.

> Note: the AWS console's region dropdown is only a *viewing filter* — it does NOT
> control where Terraform deploys. Terraform obeys only the `region` in its provider
> config, which comes from `var.aws_region` ← the tfvars file. Control flows
> code → AWS, never the reverse.

### How the backend bucket organizes state (one notebook per environment)

The backend bucket stores **Terraform state files** (the "notebooks") — NOT our data,
models, or app artifacts (those live in separate purpose-built buckets like the
datastore bucket). Its only job is bookkeeping: remembering *what infrastructure
Terraform manages*, per environment.

Environments stay isolated because each gets its own state file, set by the `key` line
in its backend config:

```
backends/dev.conf  →  key = "terraform-dev.tfstate"
backends/tst.conf  →  key = "terraform-tst.tfstate"
backends/prd.conf  →  key = "terraform-prd.tfstate"
```

So the ONE backend bucket holds three separate objects:

```
tf-remote-backend-shan-mlops45793
├── terraform-dev.tfstate   ← notebook for dev's infrastructure
├── terraform-tst.tfstate   ← notebook for tst's infrastructure
└── terraform-prd.tfstate   ← notebook for prd's infrastructure
```

This isolation means an `apply` against dev touches only the dev notebook — a mistake
in dev can never accidentally change what prd manages. That's why `init` points at a
specific `backends/<env>.conf`: it selects which notebook to use.

**Two meanings of "snapshot":**
1. **Separation by environment** — different `key`s = different notebooks (isolation).
2. **Version history** — because versioning is ON, every change to a state file keeps
   the previous version, so a corrupted state can be rolled back to an earlier one.

> One-liner for the video: *"The backend bucket is where Terraform keeps its memory —
> one notebook per environment, version-tracked so we can roll back."*

### CI/CD with GitHub Actions — automating the apply (and gating it)

**The problem:** so far *I* run `init → plan → apply` on my laptop. That's fine solo
but doesn't scale: no review, no audit trail, no consistency (works-on-my-machine),
and anyone with the keys can change prod by hand. **CI/CD** moves these runs to a
neutral, automated environment triggered by version control.

**How (`.github/workflows/infra-cicd-dev.yml`, at the REPO ROOT):**
- **Trigger:** opening a pull request into `main` that touches `terraform/**` (plus a
  manual `workflow_dispatch` button). PR = the natural place to *review* infra changes.
- **Steps:** checkout → setup Terraform → configure AWS creds (from GitHub Secrets) →
  `fmt -check` → `init` (with `backends/dev.conf`) → `validate` → `plan` →
  **manual approval gate** → `apply`. Same sequence I ran locally, now automated.
- **The approval gate** (`trstringer/manual-approval`) pauses the run and opens a
  GitHub issue; nothing is applied until an approver (me, `Suzyxx`) confirms. This is
  the "human in the loop before touching cloud infra" safeguard.

**Secrets vs. config — a key security point:**
- The AWS access key + secret are stored in **GitHub repo Secrets**, NOT in any file.
  Secrets are encrypted and never printed in logs. Committing keys to git is a classic
  breach; this avoids it.
- The `.tfvars`/`.conf` files ARE committed — they're non-secret configuration. State
  files (`*.tfstate`) and `.terraform/` stay gitignored (state can contain secrets and
  lives in S3 anyway).

🌟 **Extra-credit angles:** separate plan-on-PR vs. apply-on-merge; OIDC role
assumption instead of long-lived keys (no stored secret at all); a matrix to run
dev/tst/prd; `terraform plan` output posted as a PR comment.

### Why a feature branch + pull request (not committing to main)

Our workflow triggers on `pull_request` into `main` — i.e. "run when someone proposes
merging *into* main." A PR is by definition a request to merge **one branch into
another**, so we need a separate branch (`lesson-2-cicd`) to hold the changes. If we
committed straight to `main`, there'd be no PR and **the pipeline would never trigger**.

But it's not just a technicality — branches are what make *review* possible, which is
the whole maturity jump of lesson 2:

```
main  ───●───────────────────────●──────►   (source of truth, always-deployable)
          \                      /
           \                    / merge (after approval)
lesson-2-cicd ●──●──●  ← changes live here
                   │
                   └─ open PR → CI runs plan → human approves → apply
```

- **`main`** = trusted state of the infra; you don't want half-finished edits there.
- **feature branch** = safe scratch space; changes don't affect main until reviewed.
- **pull request** = the review checkpoint: shows the diff, runs `plan` so you can SEE
  what would change in AWS, and holds the approval gate BEFORE anything is applied.

This is the standard **GitHub Flow / trunk-based** workflow: main stays clean, work
happens on short-lived branches, changes merge back only after passing CI + review.

> Video line: *"We work on a branch and open a pull request because that's what lets
> the pipeline review and approve infra changes before they touch AWS — instead of
> applying blindly from a laptop."*

🌟 Extra-credit: enable **branch protection** on main (require the CI check to pass +
an approval before merge) so the gate can't be bypassed.

### Deprecation warnings we hit (theme: dependencies evolve, IaC/CI needs maintenance)

Both are **warnings, not errors** — everything ran green. Worth a mention in the video
because they show a real MLOps truth: the tools and dependencies underneath you keep
moving, so infra/CI code has to be maintained over time, not written once and forgotten.

1. **Terraform AWS provider (v6.49):** `acceleration_status is deprecated...` Several
   settings that used to live directly on `aws_s3_bucket` (acceleration, versioning,
   encryption) are being split into their own resources. We see it because our module's
   `output "data"` returns the *whole* bucket object. 🌟 Fix = output only specific
   fields (e.g. `value = aws_s3_bucket.s3.arn`) instead of the whole object.

2. **GitHub Actions Node.js 20 deprecation:** `checkout@v4`,
   `configure-aws-credentials@v4`, `setup-terraform@v3` run on Node 20, which GitHub is
   retiring (forced to Node 24 on 2026-06-16; Node 20 removed 2026-09-16). 🌟 Fix = bump
   each action to a newer version built for Node 24 when the maintainers release one
   (one line per action, no logic change).

**Takeaway:** pinning versions (`@v4`, provider `>=5.97`) keeps builds reproducible
*today*; periodically updating them keeps you supported. A mature team watches both.

## Lesson 3 — Data Versioning & Model Containerization (DVC + Docker)

### Why lesson 3 exists (the big picture)

Lessons 1–2 made the **infrastructure** reproducible. Lesson 3 does the same for the
**ML work itself**: the data, the model, and the runtime environment. It tackles four
real ML problems:

| Problem | What breaks without a fix | Lesson 3's answer |
|---------|---------------------------|-------------------|
| **Messy code** | One giant script nobody can debug or reproduce | A modular pipeline (`ingest→clean→train→predict`) driven by `config.yml` |
| **Data drift** | Data changes over time; "which data made this model?" is unanswerable | **DVC** versions the data alongside the code |
| **Reproducibility** | "Works on my machine" — different Python/deps elsewhere | A **virtual environment** + pinned `requirements.txt`, then **Docker** |
| **Deployment** | A `.pkl` file can't be called by anyone | **FastAPI** serves it as an API; **Docker** packages it to deploy |

### The ML pipeline (code structured for reproducibility)

**What we did:** split the ML work into single-responsibility stages, all parameterized
by one config file:
- `pipelines/ingest.py` — load `train.csv`/`test.csv` (paths from config)
- `pipelines/clean.py` — drop unused columns, impute missing values, strip the `£`/commas
  from `AnnualPremium`, remove outliers (IQR). *Real data is messy.*
- `pipelines/train.py` — preprocess (scale numerics, one-hot encode categoricals),
  apply **SMOTE**, fit the model, save `models/model.pkl`
- `pipelines/predict.py` — load the model, evaluate (accuracy, ROC-AUC, report)
- `main.py` — orchestrates the four stages; `config.yml` holds every parameter.

**Why config-driven?** To swap a DecisionTree for a RandomForest you edit **config, not
code** — so the experiment is described by a versioned file, not by remembering what you
typed. Same declarative philosophy as Terraform, applied to ML.

**Result:** `DecisionTreeClassifier` → accuracy **0.834**, ROC-AUC **0.715**.
🌟 **Why ROC-AUC, not accuracy?** The data is imbalanced (~85.6k "no" vs ~11.8k "yes").
A model that always says "no" scores ~88% accuracy while being useless. **SMOTE**
(Synthetic Minority Over-sampling) generates synthetic "yes" examples so the model
actually learns the rare class — recall on the minority went to ~0.56 instead of ~0.

> Video line: *"Each stage has one job and every parameter lives in config, so the whole
> experiment is described by versioned files — reproducible, not improvised."*

### DVC — version control for data ("git for data")

**The problem:** git is terrible at large/binary files. Our CSVs are ~6 MB *each* and
`model.pkl` is ~6 MB — committing them bloats the repo and binary diffs are meaningless.

**How DVC solves it (the core mechanic):**
- We `dvc add data` → DVC computes a **content hash**, moves the real bytes to a cache,
  and writes a tiny text **pointer file `data.dvc`** (just the hash + size).
- **Git tracks the pointer; S3 holds the bytes.** `data/` goes in `.gitignore`; `dvc push`
  uploads the actual data to the S3 remote. Git stays small and fast.
- The remote is **the Lesson-2 `datastore-dev` bucket** — the infrastructure we built
  earlier is now the storage backend for our ML data. 🎬 nice full-circle moment.

**Content-hashing gives us three things** (visible in S3 as `data/files/md5/xx/<hash>`):
integrity (a changed byte changes the hash), deduplication (identical files stored once),
and a manifest (`.dir`) mapping hashes back to filenames.

**Versioning demo (the payoff):**
| Action | Command | Result |
|--------|---------|--------|
| Tag initial data | `dvc add data` → `git tag v1` → `dvc push` | `v1` = 100,001 rows |
| Simulate drift | delete 1 row → `dvc add data` → `git tag v2` → `dvc push` | `v2` = 100,000 rows |
| Roll back | `git checkout v1 -- data.dvc` → `dvc checkout` | original data restored! |

On the `v2` push, only **2 files** uploaded (changed `train.csv` + manifest) — `test.csv`
was deduplicated and skipped. And rollback moved only a **pointer** in git; DVC swapped
the bytes. `dvc checkout` restores from local cache; `dvc pull` fetches from S3 (what a
fresh `git clone` on another machine would use).

> Video line: *"Git tracks a small hash pointer; the data bytes live in S3. So git stays
> fast, and any tagged data version is reproducible with git + dvc."*

🌟 **Extra-credit:** the same idea extends to **model versioning** — a model is truly
reproducible when code (git) + data (DVC tag) + config are pinned together; you could
also `dvc add models/` to version the artifact itself.

### Dependency drift we hit (theme: reproducibility is hard — and continues from L2)

Running the teacher's code "today" (a newer package landscape) broke twice — *not* in the
teacher's recording. Both fixed by **pinning** in `requirements.txt`:
1. **`pathspec`** — pip pulled a 1.x version that removed `_DIR_MARK`, crashing
   `dvc init`. Pinned `pathspec==0.12.1`.
2. **`boto3`/`botocore`** — `dvc[s3]` needs `boto3`, but newer `aiobotocore` stopped
   pulling it in *and* requires `botocore<1.43.1`. Pinned `boto3==1.43.0` + `botocore==1.43.0`.

🌟 This is the same lesson as L2's deprecation warnings: **dependencies evolve; pinning
keeps builds reproducible today, and you maintain those pins over time.** Living it
firsthand is good extra-credit material — the README literally names "reproducibility" as
a core challenge.

### Docker — packaging the model so it runs anywhere (and can be deployed)

**The problem Docker solves: "works on my machine."** The model currently runs only
inside *my* `.venv`, on *my* Mac, with *my* Python 3.10 and exact packages. A cloud
server won't have that. **Docker bundles the OS + Python + all dependencies + the code +
the model into one portable image** that runs *identically anywhere*. It's the virtual-env
idea taken all the way down to the operating system.

#### Key terms clarified (these confused me at first)

**What is a Docker "image"?** Nothing to do with pictures/computer vision — it's the
*other* meaning of "image" in computing, like a **disk image / ISO**: a complete frozen
snapshot of a whole environment. A Docker image is a **read-only blueprint** containing
the base OS + Python + dependencies + `app.py` + `model.pkl`, all sealed into one package.
`docker build` *generated* this; it doesn't run by itself.

**Image vs. Container:**
| Term | What it is | Analogy |
|------|-----------|---------|
| **Image** | The frozen blueprint/template (doesn't run) | A recipe / a class definition / an installer |
| **Container** | A *running instance* started from an image | The cooked dish / an object made from the class |

```
Dockerfile  →  docker build  →  IMAGE          →  docker run  →  CONTAINER
(the recipe)   (bake it)        (frozen template)  (start it)      (running app)
```
One image → can spin up many containers (build once, run identically, as many times as you want).

**What is "containerization"?** The *practice* of packaging an app into a container so it
runs in its own isolated, self-contained box. The word comes from **shipping containers**:
a standardized box any ship/truck/crane moves identically without caring what's inside —
software containers do the same for apps (self-contained, isolated, portable, consistent).
**vs. a virtual machine:** a VM boots a whole guest OS (heavy, GBs, slow); a container
shares the host's OS kernel and only packages the app + its deps (lightweight, starts in
seconds) — which is why containers are the standard unit for deploying apps/models.

> Video line: *"A Docker image isn't a picture — it's a frozen snapshot of the whole
> environment, like a disk image. Containerization means packaging the model into an
> isolated, portable box (like a shipping container) that runs the same on my laptop or in
> the cloud — and unlike a VM, it's lightweight because it shares the host OS."*

**The two files:**
- **`app.py` (FastAPI)** — wraps the `.pkl` in a web API. A `BaseModel` schema declares
  the 7 input features and their types, so pydantic **validates** every request (a
  production API can't trust its callers). `GET /` is a **health check** (cloud platforms
  ping it to confirm the container is alive — matters in Lesson 4); `POST /predict` takes
  JSON → returns `{"predicted_class": 0/1}`. The model is loaded **once at startup**.
- **`Dockerfile`** — the build recipe: `FROM python:3.13-slim` → `COPY` in app/model/
  requirements → `pip install` → `CMD` launches uvicorn on port 80.

**How we ran it:**
```
docker build -t mlops-course-03-image .
docker run -d --name mlops-course-03-container -p 80:80 mlops-course-03-image
curl http://127.0.0.1/            → {"health_check":"OK"}
curl -X POST .../predict -d '{...}' → {"predicted_class":1}
```
`-p 80:80` bridges the Mac's port 80 into the container's port 80. Interactive Swagger UI
at **http://127.0.0.1/docs**.

**Why Docker is the prerequisite for Lesson 4:** you can't deploy a loose `.pkl` + scripts
to the cloud — AWS App Runner runs **containers**. Docker turns "I trained a model" into
"I have a deployable artifact." That's the bridge.

> Video line: *"Docker packages the whole environment into a portable image that runs the
> same everywhere — which is exactly what AWS needs to deploy it in Lesson 4."*

🌟 **Extra-credit — `.dockerignore` + image hygiene:** I added a `.dockerignore`
(beyond the teacher's repo) to keep `.venv/`, `data/`, and the DVC cache out of the build
context — that's why the context was only ~6 MB. A further improvement: the serving image
installs the *full* `requirements.txt` (mlflow, jupyter, dvc) which serving doesn't need;
a production fix is a slim `requirements-serve.txt` (fastapi, uvicorn, scikit-learn,
imbalanced-learn, pandas, joblib) → smaller, faster, more secure image.

## Lesson 4 — Deploying the Model to the Cloud (ECR + App Runner)

### Why lesson 4 exists (the big picture)

Lesson 3 produced a **deployable artifact** (the Docker image). Lesson 4 gets it
**running in the cloud, reachable by a URL** — the last mile. Two new AWS pieces, with
the image push in between:

```
model image ──push──►  ECR (registry)  ──pull──►  App Runner (runs it)
                       a private "shelf"          serverless host that
                       for container images       gives a public HTTPS URL
```

| Problem | What breaks without a fix | Lesson 4's answer |
|---------|---------------------------|-------------------|
| **Image stuck on my laptop** | The cloud can't reach an image that only exists locally | **ECR** — a private cloud registry to store the image |
| **Running / scaling / HTTPS by hand** | Managing servers, TLS, restarts myself is fragile | **App Runner** — serverless: hand it an image + a port, it runs it |
| **"Is this image safe?"** | Unknown vulnerabilities ship to prod | ECR **scan-on-push** checks each image for known CVEs |
| **Runtime reading a *private* image** | App Runner can't pull without permission | An **IAM role** App Runner assumes, with ECR-read access |

> Video line: *"Lessons 1–3 built and packaged the model; Lesson 4 is the last mile —
> store the image in a cloud registry and run it on managed infrastructure, all declared
> as Terraform code."*

### MLflow — experiment tracking & model versioning (the assignment's "model versioning" topic)

**Why:** once you try different models/params, "*which* run produced the best model, and
with *what* settings?" becomes impossible to answer from memory. **MLflow records every
training run** — its parameters, metrics, and the model artifact — and **registers
versioned models** in a central registry. That's the **model-versioning** layer the
assignment explicitly asks me to explain.

**What we did:** added `mlflow_main()` to `main.py` — the same
ingest→clean→train→evaluate pipeline, wrapped in an MLflow run that **logs params +
metrics**, **logs the model** (with an input/output **signature**), and calls
`register_model` to create a new version in the **Model Registry**. Backed by a local
sqlite store (`sqlite:///mlflow.db`, so the registry works), viewed with
`mlflow ui --backend-store-uri sqlite:///mlflow.db` at http://127.0.0.1:5000.

**The demo that proves the point (experiment comparison):** I swapped the model in
`config.yml` (config, not code) and re-ran — MLflow tracked both as separate runs and
registered a new version:

| Run | Model | accuracy | roc_auc |
|-----|-------|----------|---------|
| **v1** | DecisionTreeClassifier | **0.834** | 0.715 |
| **v2** | RandomForestClassifier (max_depth=10) | 0.629 | **0.725** |

🌟 **The killer insight:** RandomForest has *lower accuracy* but *higher roc_auc*. On
imbalanced data **accuracy is misleading** (same lesson as L3's SMOTE point) — roc_auc is
the metric to compare on, and by *that* measure RandomForest is the better model. **This
is exactly why experiment tracking matters:** without MLflow logging both runs side by
side, you'd "remember" DecisionTree's 83% accuracy and wrongly pick it; with it, you
compare on the right metric and choose deliberately. (I kept DecisionTree as the shipped
model for consistency with L3 + the image already in ECR, but the registry holds both
versions.) Also note the v1 numbers **exactly match Lesson 3** — same code + data version
→ same model = reproducibility, demonstrated.

### ECR — a cloud registry for the image

**Why:** App Runner (or any cloud runtime) can't pull an image sitting on my Mac. ECR is
a **private Docker registry** — the cloud "shelf" the image must live on first. We
declared it the *mature* way (same module pattern as the S3 bucket), with `scan_on_push`
on and `MUTABLE` tags (so re-pushing `:latest` overwrites while iterating).

**The push flow (3 commands, each solving one thing):**
| Step | Command (abridged) | Why |
|------|--------------------|-----|
| **Log in** | `aws ecr get-login-password … \| docker login …` | ECR is *private*; this fetches a temporary 12-hour token so Docker may push |
| **Tag** | `docker tag mlops-course-03-image:latest <ecr-uri>:latest` | Docker decides *where* to push from the image's name; the tag is an **alias** pointing at the ECR repo (no copy) |
| **Push** | `docker push <ecr-uri>:latest` | Uploads the image layers to ECR; the scan then runs automatically |

Result: `001277371466.dkr.ecr.eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/mlops-course-shan-repository-dev:latest`
— the model image, now a **versioned, scanned artifact in the cloud.**

> Video line: *"ECR is a private shelf for container images. I log Docker in with a
> temporary token, tag the image with the registry's address, and push — now the image
> lives in the cloud, not just on my laptop."*

🌟 **Scan-on-push: the security payoff (and a real gotcha I hit).** ECR's
`scan_on_push` auto-checks each image for known CVEs. My *first* scan said **"Scan not
found"** — because modern Docker (buildx) pushes images as an **OCI image index** with
provenance/SBOM attestations, a format ECR **basic scanning can't read**
(`UnsupportedImageTypeException`). **Fix:** rebuild with
`docker build --provenance=false --sbom=false` to produce a plain single-platform
manifest, then re-push. The scan then ran and found **3 HIGH + 2 MEDIUM** vulnerabilities
— **all in the `perl` package** baked into the `python:3.13-slim` base image, which my app
doesn't even use. Two lessons in one: (1) the **registry adds security** by flagging CVEs
automatically, and (2) concrete proof for the **slim-image** point — a smaller base ships
fewer packages = fewer CVEs = less attack surface. (Same "tooling evolves underneath you"
theme as the dependency-drift fixes.)

> Video line: *"The registry scanned my image automatically and found 5 CVEs — all in
> `perl`, which my model never uses. It came free with the base image. That's a live
> argument for a slimmer image: fewer packages, fewer vulnerabilities."*

🌟 **Why modules? (a question raised in class)** Lesson 4 is the proof. Adding ECR *and*
App Runner each took the **identical pattern** as the S3 bucket: a small reusable
`module/` + one entry in `dev.tfvars` + a `for_each` loop. A module is **to
infrastructure what a function is to code** — write "how to make one X" once, call it
anywhere, fix it in one place. Without modules you copy-paste a full resource block per
repo/service/environment, and any rule change means editing every copy (that's how infra
rots). With modules, **infra scales by data, not by duplicated code.**

### App Runner — the serverless runtime (the deploy target)

**What it is:** a managed service that **pulls the image from ECR, runs the container,
gives a public HTTPS URL, and handles scaling + TLS** for me. Versus raw EC2: no servers
to patch or manage — I just declare "run this image on port 80."

**Two things worth explaining on camera:**
- **The IAM role (why it exists):** App Runner is a *separate AWS service*, so to read my
  **private** ECR image it must **assume a role** that's allowed to. The role trusts the
  `build.apprunner.amazonaws.com` principal and attaches AWS's managed
  `AWSAppRunnerServicePolicyForECRAccess` policy. This is least-privilege in action:
  permission is granted explicitly, not assumed.
- **`auto_deployments_enabled = true`:** when a *new* image is pushed to that ECR tag,
  App Runner redeploys itself automatically — that's **continuous deployment for the
  model**, the CD that closes the loop.

**Full-circle tie:** App Runner health-checks the container by hitting `GET /` on port 80
— which is *exactly* why `app.py` has a `{"health_check": "OK"}` route and the
`Dockerfile` binds `--host 0.0.0.0 --port 80`. Lesson 3 was quietly building for this.

### The limitation I hit — App Runner needs an account subscription (a real MLOps lesson)

`terraform apply` created the IAM role, then failed on the service:
```
Error: SubscriptionRequiredException: The AWS Access Key Id needs a subscription for the service
```
This is **not a code bug** (the plan was perfect) — it's an **account-level entitlement**:
my AWS account isn't signed up for App Runner (common on brand-new accounts whose billing
isn't fully activated yet).

🔑 **Region vs. account — two different causes, same symptom.** A classmate hit App Runner
failing in **`eu-north-1` (Stockholm)** and fixed it by switching to `eu-west-1` — because
App Runner **isn't offered in eu-north-1 at all** (a *region availability* problem). But
**I'm already in `eu-west-1`** and still got blocked, so mine is an *account subscription*
problem, which changing region cannot fix. Reading the error precisely is the skill.

(Also: this has nothing to do with being logged into the AWS console. Terraform
authenticates with the stored **access key** of the `terraform-cli` IAM user, not my
browser session.)

**What I did about it (the engineer's move):**
1. **Kept all the App Runner Terraform** (`modules/apprunner-service/` +
   `apprunner_services.tf` + the commented config in `dev.tfvars`) — it's a finished
   "this is how you'd deploy it" artifact, ready to flip on in 2 minutes if the account
   activates before the deadline.
2. **Disabled the instance** (empty list via the variable default) and re-applied to
   **clean up the orphaned IAM role**, so state stays tidy.
3. The image **is** in ECR (verified with `aws ecr describe-images`) and **is** runnable
   (proven by the Lesson-3 local `docker run`). So deployment is proven all the way to the
   final "press play" — which is an account permission, not an engineering gap.

> itself needs an account subscription my new account doesn't have yet — and being able to
> read that error, tell it apart from my classmate's region issue, and fall back cleanly
> is itself the MLOps lesson."*

### App CI/CD — automating retrain → build → push (`app-cicd-dev.yml`)

**Why:** today I built + pushed the image to ECR **by hand** (login → build → tag → push).
That's manual, error-prone, and only works from my laptop. The app CI/CD workflow
**automates it**: on a pull request touching `src/**` (or a manual run), GitHub Actions
retrains the model and ships a fresh image to ECR — no human steps.

**What it does, step by step:** checkout → set up Python → install deps → configure AWS
creds (repo secrets) → **`dvc pull`** (fetch the *versioned* dataset from the S3 remote, so
CI trains on exactly the data git points at) → **retrain** (`python main.py` → fresh
`model.pkl`) → **ECR login** → **build + push** the image. With App Runner's
`auto_deployments_enabled`, a new image would then auto-redeploy — closing the loop *code
change → live model* (the one link blocked by the account).

**Mirror of Lesson 2:** same GitHub Actions + repo-secrets pattern as the *infra* pipeline,
now for the **app/model** instead of infrastructure. The infra pipeline has a **manual
approval gate** (applying infra is sensitive); the app pipeline doesn't (pushing an image
is lower-risk). New secret added: `ECR_REPOSITORY` (the repo URI — kept out of the public
workflow file). 🌟 I also added `--provenance=false` to the CI build (from the scan-on-push
gotcha) so images pushed by CI stay scannable.

> Video line: *"The app CI/CD workflow turns my manual `docker push` into a hands-free
> pipeline: change the code, and GitHub Actions pulls the versioned data, retrains, and
> pushes a fresh image to ECR automatically — the same automation idea as my Lesson-2 infra
> pipeline, now for the model."*

🌟 **Extra-credit directions:** (a) **ECS Fargate** as an alternative runtime that doesn't
need the App Runner subscription; (b) the **slim `requirements-serve.txt`** to shrink the
3 GB serving image (mlflow/jupyter/dvc aren't needed to *serve*).

### The thread tying all four lessons together (the video's backbone)

The MLOps move is identical every time: **declare it in a file → version it in git →
reproduce it anywhere.** Only the *thing* being managed changes:

| Layer | "Code" that declares it | Versioned in |
|-------|------------------------|--------------|
| **Infrastructure** | Terraform `.tf` files | git |
| **Data** | DVC `data.dvc` pointers + tags | git (pointer) + S3 (bytes) |
| **Runtime environment** | `Dockerfile` + `requirements.txt` | git |
| **Deployment** | Terraform `ecr_repositories.tf` + `apprunner_services.tf` | git (config) + ECR (image, by tag) |

> Closing video line: *"Whether it's infrastructure, data, the runtime environment, or the
> deployment itself, the MLOps move is the same — describe it as code, version it, and
> reproduce it on demand. That's what makes the whole project repeatable instead of 'it
> worked once on my laptop.'"*
